<h1>Features</h1>
<p>Hi, we're the Kaelin Hoang and Khanhly Nguyen, otherwise known as the Keyboard Kardashians. The typing game we created
    is built primarily using PIXI.js with 3 main components:
    <ul>
        <li>The database</li>
        <li>The controllers</li>
        <li>The game logic</li>
    </ul>
    Our game tests the player's typing abilities by having a series of words fall from the screen and the user is tasked 
    with successfully typing words associated to each meteor in order to accumulate points to make it onto the scoreboard 
    when the player loses all of his or her lives. The player also has the opportunity to buy a "clear screen" button in 
    which all the meteors currently on the screen will disappear at a cost of 50 points. This is a tradeoff between lives 
    and a high score so the player should choose wisely.

    The premise of the game is to destroy as many falling meteors as possible to obtain a high score. Each meteor has an 
    associated word and the player is tasked with destroying as many meteors as possible as seen below:

    Each player is given 4 lives which we track with a list of dinosaurs. When a player loses a life, we remove the last 
    dinosaur from our list and we constantly check if the list is empty. When all lives are lost, a game over message is 
    displayed along with a list of names with their associated high score. This name is collected at the beginning of 
    each game and will prevent the user from playing the game if a name is not entered.
