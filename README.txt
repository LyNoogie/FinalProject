Comments to Evaluators:

Keyrannosaurus Text is a typing game with the objective of saving dinosaurs from meteors that are falling to earth. By typing a word correctly, 
a meteor will be destroyed, thus saving the dinosaurs from destruction for a few more seconds. Each meteor destroyed increases the user’s score 
by the number of letters within the word. After four meteors have hit the ground, killing the dinosaur friends in the process, the player loses the game. 

We encountered a few issues leading up to the final result of this game. For example, we encountered many issues that involved a lot of research since many 
areas of PIXI that we wanted to use were out of date on their documentation or could not be found. Therefore we had to use many references to get the behavior that we wanted.

Regardless of the obstacles that we encountered and the many hours we spent on this project, we had a lot of fun learning and growing along the way. We worked tirelessly 
in order to get a functional game and we hope you have fun grading our game as much as we had making it.
